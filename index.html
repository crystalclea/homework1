  The United States ranks third in terms of the number of departures to foreign countries for travelling, according to the  <a href="http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/ST.INT.DPRT?order=wbapi_data_value_2009+wbapi_data_value+wbapi_data_value-first&sort=desc&year_high_desc=true" target="_blank">World Bank</a>(behind Hong Kong and Germany).<br> <br>
  To get a passport in America is an easy process as all you have to do is visit the website of US Department of State and go through the application process online. <br> <br> 
  And the number of passports issued has been increasing year by year too as seen from a graph released by the State Department.
