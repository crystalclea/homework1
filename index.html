  The United States ranks third in terms of the number of departures to foreign countries for travelling, according to the  
    <a href="http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/ST.INT.DPRT?order=wbapi_data_value_2009+wbapi_data_value+wbapi_data_value-first&sort=desc&year_high_desc=true" target="_blank">World Bank</a> (behind Hong Kong and Germany).<br> <br>
  To get a passport in America is an easy process as all you have to do is visit the website of US Department of State and go through the application process online. <br> <br> 
  And the number of passports issued has been increasing year by year too as seen from a graph released by  <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/passports/statistics.html" target="_blank">the State Department</a>. <br> <br>

    <br> <br> 
    At first glance, it appears that there's a healthy increase in the number of passports issued since a record low in 2011. <br> <br> 
    But a closer look at the percentage of population holding passports tells different story. <br> <br> 

    Based on the estimation of the State Department, the number of outstanding valid passports in circulation is about 131,841,062. 
    If we divide the number by the total American population, estimated to be 325,103,000 as of December 2016 
    by the Census Department and minus the the approximately 11.1 million people who are undocumented residents 
    and 13.3 million legal permanent residents that live in the U.S. but cannot obtain passports or have valid 
    passports issued from other countries - we get the number that only 40 percent of the US population holds passports. <br> <br> 
    <script src="https://infograph.venngage.com/js/embed/v1/embed.js" data-vg-id="211626" data-title="Passport holder" data-w="640" data-h="640"></script>
    <br> 
    By dividing the passport circulation figures by the US population year by year, we get to see the percentages of ownership do not have much of a significant change over the period. It stays well below 40 percent. 
    <br> <br> 
    This means more than half of the population cannot travel to the rest of the world except for Canada (until recently, Americans don't need a passport to travel to Canada). 
    <br> <br>
    As compared to other countries, the percentage of people holding passports in the US is significantly lower with  
    <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk" target="_blank">the UK</a> being 95 percent in 2014, Australia being 75 percent and Canada at 60 percent. 
    <br> <br>
     So while Trump is banning people from entering the country, Americans aren't very keen to travel to elsewhere either. 
    <br> <br> 
    But why is it that Americans don't travel a lot by comparison? 
    <br> <br> 
    Americans travel a lot domestically but they just don't get outside. Here're few reasons behind:
    </p>
         <br> <br> 
 <p>
 1. It's just too expensive
  <br> <br> 
   Though the application process is easy, obtaining a passport isnâ€™t exactly cheap. 
      At $135, we have the fifth most expensive passport in the world. That may not seem 
      like a lot to some people, but it actually takes 19 hours of work at minimum wage.
      <br> <br> 
      Another financial issue hitting our face is that students in America are having a major debt issue. 
      An article by <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/specialfeatures/2013/08/07/how-the-college-debt-is-crippling-students-parents-and-the-economy/#2ca5ac601a41" target="_blank">Forbes</a> states that 
      America is suffering from over $1 trillion in student loan debt, surpassing credit card debt.
      <br> <br>
 2. Americans don't take vacations
        <br> <br> 
  The average amount of paid vacation time in America is two weeks. 
      According to <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/tanyamohn/2013/08/13/paid-time-off-forget-about-it-a-report-looks-at-how-the-u-s-compares-to-other-countries/#10f28ea7bd8a" target="_blank">Forbes</a>, 
      the United States is the only advanced economy that does not require employers to provide paid vacation time. 
      Even worse, Forbes explains that nearly 1-in-4 Americans do not receive any paid vacation or paid holidays. 
       
        <br> <br> 
  3. Americans don't travel because of media bias
        <br> <br>
   
            There is a serious lack of information about the world affairs in the United States. In a 2014 <a href="http://www.wsj.com/news/interactive/POLLJP0910?ref=SB10001424052970203523604580144222896962304" target="_blank"> Wall Street Journal/NBC poll</a>, 
            94 percent of respondents were familiar with the murders of two U.S. journalists by ISIS, and 47 percent think that the country 
            is less safe than before the 9/11 attacks.
            <br> <br> 
            But that has to do more with the fact that major American news outlets are instilling fear through rampant airing of "Islamic State" related stories.
             <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/09/09/isis-media-threat_n_5791594.html" target="_blank">Experts</a> say Americans panick over threat that isn't imminent because of such news coverage. 
            So some Americans might have chickened out before they step out of the country.
