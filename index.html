  The United States ranks third in terms of the number of departures to foreign countries for travelling, according to the  <a href="http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/ST.INT.DPRT?order=wbapi_data_value_2009+wbapi_data_value+wbapi_data_value-first&sort=desc&year_high_desc=true" target="_blank">World Bank</a>(behind Hong Kong and Germany).<br> <br>
  To get a passport in America is an easy process as all you have to do is visit the website of US Department of State and go through the application process online. <br> <br> 
  And the number of passports issued has been increasing year by year too as seen from a graph released by the State Department. <br> <br>

    At first glance, it appears that there's a health increase in the number of passports issued since a record low in 2011. <br> <br> 
    But a closer look at the percentage of population holding passports tells different story. <br> <br> 
    Based on the estimation of the State Department, the number of outstanding valid passports in circulation is about 131,841,062. 
    If we divide the number by the total American population, estimated to be 325,103,000 as of December 2016 
    by the Census Department and minus the the approximately 11.1 million people who are undocumented residents 
    and 13.3 million legal permanent residents that live in the U.S. but cannot obtain passports or have valid 
    passports issued from other countries - we get the number that only 46% of the US population holds passports. <br> <br> 
    This means half of the population cannot travel to Canada and the rest of the world.
